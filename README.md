# BASIC-C-COMPILER
The Basic C Compiler is a simplified compiler for a subset of the C programming language, developed entirely in C++. This project provides a functional understanding of how C source code is translated into machine-readable instructions, covering the core stages of compilation from lexical analysis to code generation.
